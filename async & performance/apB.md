# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Appendix B: Advanced Async Patterns

If you've read and understood Appendix A on the *asynquence* library, you're now ready to see how it can enable some powerful and sophisticated asynchronous patterns beyond just promises and generators.

## Summary

Promises and generators provide the foundational building blocks upon which we can build much more sophisticated and capable asynchrony.
