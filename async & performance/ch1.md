# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Chapter 1: Asynchrony

One of the most important and yet often misunderstood parts of programming in a language like JavaScript is understanding how to express and manipulate program behavior spread out over a period of time.

This is not just about what happens from the beginning of a `for` loop to the end of a `for` loop, which of course takes *some time* (microseconds to milliseconds) to complete. It's about what happens when part of your program runs *now*, and another part of your program runs *later* -- there's a gap between *now* and *later* where your program isn't actively executing.

Practically all non-trivial programs ever written (especially in JS) have had in some way or another had to manage this gap, whether that be in waiting for user input, requesting data from a database or file system, sending data across the network and waiting for a response, or performing a repeated task at a fixed interval of time (like animation). In all these various ways, your program has to manage state across the gap in time. As they famously say in London (of the subway system): "mind the gap".

In fact, the relationships between the *now* and *later* parts of your program is at the heart of asynchronous programming.

Asynchronous programming has been around since the beginning of JS, for sure. But most JS developers have never really carefully considered exactly how and why it crops up in their programs, or explored various *other* ways to handle it. The *good enough* approach has always been the humble callback function. Many to this day will insist that callbacks are more than sufficient.

But as JS continues to grow in both scope and complexity, to meet the ever widening demands of a first-class programming language that runs in browsers and servers and every conceivable device in between, the pains by which we manage asynchrony are becoming increasingly crippling, and they cry out for approaches that are both more capable and more reason-able.

While this all may seem rather abstract right now, I assure you we're tackle it more completely and concretely as we go on through this book. We'll explore a variety of emerging techniques for async JavaScript programming over the next several chapters.

But before we can get there, we're going to have to understand much more deeply what asynchrony is and how it operates in JS.

## Event Loop

Let's start off with the first (perhaps shocking) claim: up until recently (ES6), JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchrony built into it.

**What!?** That seems like a crazy claim, right? In fact, it's quite true. The JS engine itself has never done anything more than execute a single section of your program at any given moment, when asked to.

"Asked to." By whom? That's the important part. The JS engine doesn't run in isolation. It runs inside a *hosting environment*, which is for most developers the typical web browser. Over the last several years (but by no means exlusively), JS has expanded beyond the browser into other environments, such as servers, via things like node.js. In fact, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices these days, from robots to lightbulbs.

But the one common "thread" (that's a not-so-subtle asynchronous joke, btw) of all these environments is that they have a mechanism in them that handles executing multiple chunks of your program *over time*, at each moment invoking the JS engine, called the "event loop".

In other words, the JS engine has had no inate sense of *time*, but has instead been an on-demand execution environment for any arbitrary snippet of JS. It's the surrouding environment which has always *scheduled* "events" (JS code executions).

So, for example, when your JS program makes an Ajax request to fetch some data from a server, you set up the "response" code in a function (commonly called a "callback"), and the JS engine tells the hosting environment basically, "hey, I'm going to suspend execution for now, but whenever you finish with that network request, and you have some data, please *call-back* to this function."

The browser then is set up to listen for the response from the network, and when it has something to give you, it schedules the callback function to be executed by inserting it into the *event loop*.

So what is the *event loop*?

Let's conceptualize it first through some fake'ish code:

```js
// `eventLoop` is an array that acts as a queue (first-in-first-out)
var eventLoop = [ ];
var event;

// keep going "forever"
while (true) {
	// perform a "tick"
	if (eventLoop.length > 0) {
		// get the next event in the queue
		event = eventLoop.shift();

		// now, execute the next event
		try {
			event();
		}
		catch (err) {
			reportError(err);
		}
	}
}
```

This is of course vastly simplified code to illustrate the concepts. As you can see, there's a continuously running loop represented by the `while` loop, and each iteration of this loop is called a "tick".
