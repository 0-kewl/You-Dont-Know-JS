# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Chapter 3: Promises

In Chapter 2, we identified two major categories of deficiencies with using callbacks to express program asynchrony and manage concurrency. But now that we understand the problems more intimately, it's time we turn our attention to patterns that can address them.

The issue we want to address first is the *inversion of control*, the trust that is so fragilely held and so easily lost.

Recall that we wrap up the *continuation* of our program in a callback function, and hand that callback over to another party (potentially even external code) and just cross our fingers that it will do the right thing with the invocation of the callback.

We do this because we want to say, "here's what happens *later*, after the current step finishes."

But what if we could uninvert that *inversion of control*? What if instead of handing the continuation of our program to the the other party utility, we could expect that utility to return us the capability to know when the step finishes, and then our code would decide what to do next?

We can do just that, and it's called **Promises**.

## What is a Promise?

When developers decide to learn a new technology or pattern, usually their first step is, "Show me the code!" It's quite natural for us to just jump in feet first and learn as we go.

But it turns out that some abstractions get lost on the APIs alone. Promises are one of those tools where it can be painfully obvious from how someone uses it whether they understand what it's for and about versus just learning and using the API.

So, before I show the Promise code, I want to explain what really is a Promise, conceptually. I hope this will then guide you better as you explore integrating promise theory into your own async flow.

With that in mind, let's look at two different metaphors for what a Promise *is*.

### Future Value

When you write code to reason about a value, such as performing math on a `number`, whether you realize it or not, you've been assuming something very fundamental about that value, which is that it's a concrete *now* value already.

```js
var x, y = 2;

console.log( x + y ); // NaN  <-- because `x` isn't set yet
```

The `x + y` operations assumes both `x` and `y` are already set, or in other words (to borrow a term we'll shortly rely on), that those values are already *resolved*.

It would seem like nonsense to expect that the `+` operator would somehow be magically capable of waiting around until both `x` and `y` are resolved (aka ready), and then do the operation. That would cause chaos in the program if different statements finished *now* and others finished *later*, right?

How could you possibly reason about the relationships between two statements if either one (or both) of them might not be finished yet. If statement 2 relies on statement 1 being finished, there's two outcomes: either statement 1 finished right *now*, or statement 1 didn't finish yet, and thus statement 2 is going to fail.

If this sort of thing sounds familiar from Chapter 1, good!

Let's go back to our `x + y` math operation. Imagine if there was a way to say, "add `x` and `y`, and if either of them isn't ready yet, just wait until they are, but regardless, add them when you can."

Your brain might have just jumped to callbacks. OK, so...

```js
function add(getX,getY,cb) {
	var x, y;
	getX( function(xVal){
		x = xVal;
		// both are ready?
		if (y != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
	getY( function(yVal){
		y = yVal;
		// both are ready?
		if (x != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
}

// fetchX and fetchY are sync or async
// functions
add( fetchX, fetchY, function(sum){
	console.log( sum ); // that was easy, huh?
});
```

Take just a moment to let the beauty (or lack thereof) of that snippet sink in.

**Note:** Whistles patiently.

While the ugliness is undeniable, there's something very important to notice about this async pattern.

In that snippet, we treated `x` and `y` as future values, and we expressed an operation `add(..)` which (from the outside) did not care whether `x` or `y` or both were available right away or not. In otherwise, it normalized the *now* and *later*, such that we'd have a predictable outcome of the `add(..)` operation.

By using an `add(..)` that is temporally consistent -- behaving the same across *now* and *later* -- the async code is much easier to reason about.

Of course, this rough callbacks-based approach leaves much to be desired. It's just a first tiny step toward realizing the benefits of reasoning about future values without worrying about the *time* aspect of when it's available or not.

## Summary

Promises are awesome. Use them. They solve all the *inversion of control* issues that plague us with callbacks-only code.

They don't get rid of callbacks, they just redirect the orchestration of those callbacks to a trustable intermediary mechanism that sits between us and the other party utility -- namely, the Promise mechanism.

Promise chains also begin to address (though certainly not perfectly) a better way of expressing async flow in sequential fashion, which helps our brains plan and maintain async JS code better.
