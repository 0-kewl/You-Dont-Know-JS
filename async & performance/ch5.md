# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Chapter 5: Program Performance

This book so far has been all about how to leverage asynchrony patterns more effectively. But we sort of left a little unspoken/implicit why asynchrony really matters to JS. The most obvious explicit reason is **performance**.

For example, if you have two Ajax requests to make, and they're independent, but you need to wait on them both to finish before doing the next task, you have two options for modeling that interaction: serial and concurrent.

You could make the first request and wait to start the second request until the first finishes. Or, as we've seen both with promises and generators, you could make both requests "in parallel", and express the "gate" to wait on both of them before moving on.

Clearly, the latter is usually going to be more performant than the former. And better performance generally leads to better user experience.

It's even possible that asynchrony (interleaved concurrency) can improve just the perception of performance, even if the overall program still takes the same amount of time to complete. User perception of performance is every bit -- if not more! -- as important as actual measurable performance.

We want to now move beyond localized asynchrony patterns to talk about some bigger picture performance details at the program level.

**Note:** You may be wondering about micro-performance issues like if `a++` or `++a` is faster, etc. We'll look at those sorts of performance details in the next chapter on "Benchmarking & Tuning".

## Web Workers

If you have processing intensive tasks but you don't want them to run on the main thread which may slow down the browser/UI, you may wish that JavaScript had a concept of operating multithreaded.

In Chapter 1, we talked in detail about how JavaScript is single-threaded. And that's still true. But a single-thread isn't the only way to organize the execution of your program.

Imagine splitting your program into two pieces, and running one of those pieces on the main UI thread, and running the other piece on an entirely separate thread.

What kinds of concerns would such an architecture bring up?

For one, you'd want to know if running on a separate thread meant that it ran in parallel (on systems with multiple CPUs/cores) such that a long-running process on that second thread would **not** block the main program thread. Otherwise, "virtual threading" wouldn't be of much benefit over what we already have in JS with async concurrency.

And you'd want to know if these two pieces of the program have access to the same shared scope/resources. If they do, then you have all the questions that multithreaded languages (Java, C++, etc) deal with, such as needing cooperative or preemptive locking (mutexes, etc). That's a lot of extra work, and shouldn't be undertaken lightly.

Alternatively, you'd want to know how these two pieces could "communicate" if they couldn't share scope/resources.

All these are great questions to consider as we explore a feature added to the web platform circa HTML5 called "Web Workers". This is a feature of the browser (aka host environment) and actually has almost nothing to do with the JS language itself. That is, JavaScript does not currently have any features that support threaded execution.

But an environment like your browser can easily provide multiple instances of the JavaScript engine, each on its own thread, and let you run a different program in each thread. Each of those separate threaded pieces of your program is called a "(Web) Worker".

From your main JS program (or another Worker), you instantiate a Worker like so:

```js
var w1 = new Worker( "http://some.url.1/mycoolworker.js" );
```

The URL should point to the location of a JS file (not an HTML page!) which is intended to be loaded into a Worker. The browser will then spin up a separate thread and let that file run as an independent program in that thread.

**Note:** The kind of Worker created with such a URL is called a "Dedicated Worker". But instead of providing a URL to an external file, you can also create an "Inline Worker" by providing a Blob URL (another HTML5 feature); essentially it's an inline file stored in a single (binary) value. However, Blobs are beyond the scope of what we'll discuss here.

Workers do not share any scope or resources with each other or the main program -- that would bring all the nightmares of theaded programming to the forefront -- but instead have a basic event messaging mechanism connecting them.

The `w1` Worker object is an event listener and trigger, which lets you subscribe to events sent by the Worker as well as send events to the Worker.

Here's how to listen for events (actually, the fixed `"message"` event):

```js
w1.addEventListener( "message", function(evt){
	// evt.data
} );
```

And you can send events to the Worker:

```js
w1.postMessage( "something cool to say" );
```

Inside the Worker, the messaging is totally symmetrical:

```js
// "mycoolworker.js"

addEventListener( "message", function(evt){
	// evt.data
} );

postMessage( "a really cool reply" );
```

Notice that a dedicated worker is in a one-to-one relationship with the program that created it. That is, the `"message"` event doesn't need any disambiguation here, because we're sure that it could only have come from this one-to-one relationship -- either it came from the Worker or the main page.

Usually the main page application creates the Workers, but a Worker can instantiate its own child Worker(s) as necessary. Sometimes this is useful to delegate such details to a sort of "master" Worker that spawns other Workers to process parts of a task.

If you have two or more pages (or tabs with the same page!) in the browser that try to create a Worker from the same file URL, those will actually end up as completely separate Workers. Shortly, we'll discuss a way to "share" a Worker.

**Note:** It may seem like a malicious or ignorant JS program could easily perform a denial-of-service attack on a system by spawning hundreds of Workers, seemingly each with their own thread. While it's true that it's somewhat of a guarantee that a Worker will end up on a separate thread, this guarantee is not unlimited. The system is free to decide how many actual threads/CPUs/cores it really wants to create. There's no way to predict or guarantee how many you'll have access to, though many people assume it's at least as many as the number of CPUs/cores available. I think the safest assumption is that there's at least one other thread besides the main UI thread, but that's about it.
