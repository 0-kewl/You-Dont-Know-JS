# You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond
# Chapter 5: Collections

Structured collection and access to data is a critical component of just about any JS program. From the beginning of the language up to this point, the array and the object have been our primary mechanism for creating data structures. Of course, many higher-level data structures have been built on top of these, as user-land libraries.

As of ES6, some of the most useful (and performance-optimizing!) data structure abstractions have been added as native components of the language.

We'll start this chapter first by looking at *Typed Arrays*, which are technically well-preceding current ES6 efforts, but which prior to ES6 were only standardized by the web platform and not JavaScript. As of ES6, these have been adopted directly by the language specification, which gives them first-class status.

Then we'll look at Maps and Sets, as well as their weak-key ("weak" in relation to memory/garbage collection) counterparts.
