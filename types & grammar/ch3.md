# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
# Chapter 3: Coercion

Converting a value from one type to another is often called "type casting", when done explicitly, and "coercion" when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used).

However, in JavaScript, most people refer to all type conversions as *coercion*, so the way I prefer to distinguish is to say "implicit coercion" vs "explicit coercion".
