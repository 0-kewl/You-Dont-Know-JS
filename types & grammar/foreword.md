# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
# Foreword

It was once said that "JavaScript is the only language developers don't learn to use before using it."

I laugh each time I hear that quote because it was true for me and I suspect it was for many other developers.  JavaScript, and maybe even CSS or HTML, were not a core computer science language taught at college in the internet's early days so personal development was very much on the budding developer's search and "view source" abilities to piece together these basic web languages.

I still remember my first high school website project.  The task was to create any type of web store, and me being a James Bond fan, I decided to create a Goldeneye store.  It had everything:  the Goldeneye midi theme song playing in the background, a JavaScript-powered crosshairs following the mouse around the screen, and a gunshot sound that played upon every click.  Q would have been proud of this masterpiece of a website.

I tell that story because I did back then what many developers are doing today:  copy and pasted chunks of JavaScript code into my project without having a clue what's actually happening.  The widespread use of JavaScript toolkits like jQuery have, in their own small way, perpetuated this pattern of non-learning of core JavaScript.

Types and Grammar, the third installment of Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" series, is an excellent look at the core JavaScript fundamentals that copy and paste and JavaScript toolkits don't and could never teach you.
