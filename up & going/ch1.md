# You Don't Know JS: Up & Going
# Chapter 1: Into Programming

Welcome to the *"You Don't Know JS"* (YDKJS) book series. This book serves as an introduction to important concepts in general programming, JavaScript specifically, and finally how to approach and understand the rest of the books in the series.

This chapter will explain the basic principles of programming in modern languages, at a very high level. It's intended if you are reading this but have little to no prior programming experience and are looking to the YDKJS books to help you along your path to understanding programming through the lens of JS.

If you have more than 2 months experience with programming with any modern language, you can probably safely skip over this chapter and jump straight into Chapter 2 *"Into JavaScript"*.
