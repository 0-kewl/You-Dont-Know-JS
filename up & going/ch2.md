# You Don't Know JS: Up & Going
# Chapter 2: Into JavaScript

In the previous chapter, I introduced the basic building blocks of programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Of course, all the code shown has been in JavaScript. But in this chapter, we want to focus specifically on things you need to know about JavaScript to get up and going as a JS developer.

You should be aware that we will introduce quite a few concepts in this chapter which we will not fully explore here, but rather give you just a preview of them. You can think then of this chapter as an overview for the topics covered in detail throughout the rest of this book series.

Especially if you're new to JavaScript, you should expect to spend quite a bit of time going over the concepts and code examples here multiple times. Any good foundation is laid brick by brick, so don't expect that you'll get it all at once the first pass through.

Your journey to deeply learn JavaScript starts here.
