# You Don't Know JS: Up & Going
# Chapter 3: Into YDKJS

What is this book series all about? Put simply, it's about taking seriously the task of learning **all parts of JavaScript**, not just some subset of the language that someone called "the good parts", and not just whatever minimal amount you need to get your job done at work.

Serious developers in other languages expect to put in the effort to learn most or all of the language(s) they primarily write in, but JS developers seem to stand out from the crowd in the sense of typically not learning very much of the language. This is not a good thing, and it's not something we should continue to allow to be the norm.

The *"You Don't Know JS"* (YDKJS) book series stands in stark contrast to the typical approaches to learning JS, and is unlike almost any other JS books you will read. It challenges you to go beyond your comfort zone and to ask the deeper "why" questions for every single behavior you encounter. Are you up for that challenge?

I'm going to spend the balance of this final chapter briefly summarizing what to expect from the rest of the books in the series, and how to most effectively go about building a foundation of JS learning on top of YDKJS.

## Scope & Closures

Perhaps one of the most fundamental things you'll need to quickly come to terms with is how scoping of variables really works in JavaScript. It's not enough to have anecdotal fuzzy *beliefs* about scope.

The *"Scope & Closures"* title starts by debunking the common misconception that JS is an "interpreted language" and therefore not compiled. Rubbish.

The JS engine compiles your code right before (and sometimes during!) execution. So we use some deeper understanding of the compiler's approach to our code to understand how it finds and deals with variable and function declarations. Along the way, we see the typical metaphor for JS variable scope management, "hoisting".

This critical understanding of "lexical scope" is what we then base our exploration of closure on for the last chapter of the book. Closure is perhaps the single most important concept in all of JS, but if you haven't first grasped firmly how scope works, closure will likely remain beyond your grasp.
